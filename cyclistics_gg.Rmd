## **DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS**

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since
then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general
awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.The director of
marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing
the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes
differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing
strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first,
Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

### **ASK**

*The questions we needs to answer:*

1\. How do annual members and casual rides use Cyclistic bikes
differently?

2\. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3\. How can Cylistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
become members?

### PREPARE

The dataset The past data trip was obtained from here
(<https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>).

Its a public data set prepared by the Motivate International Inc
("Motivate"), the bike - sharing company operated in Chicago, Illinois,
USA. Since its a first party data sets, the data is considered as
fulfilling the ROCCC requirement ie. the data is reliable, original,
comprehensive, current, and cited.

### 

I chose the data set from April 2020 to March 2021 since it's lighten
and fulls of a year which still gives us a better view about their
business. However, it takes us a lot of time to download full 12 months
and extract them. By default, they are .csv files.

### **PROCESS**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(hms)
```

Load data

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
d4 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202004-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d5 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202005-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d6 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202006-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d7 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202007-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d8 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202008-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d9 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202009-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d10 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202010-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d11 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202011-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d12 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202012-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d1 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202101-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d2 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202102-divvy-tripdata.csv")
d3 <- read.csv("D:\online course\Case Study_Cyclistic\Cyclistics_Google Course\data\202103-divvy-tripdata.csv")

```

Now, check all the data structure to consider whether their data types
are consistent or not

```{r}
str(d1)
str(d2)
str(d3)
str(d4)
str(d5)
str(d6)
str(d7)
str(d8)
str(d9)
str(d10)
str(d11)
str(d12)
```

Group d4 -> d11 have start_station_id and end_station_id is int while
the rest are chr. Therefore, combine these data sets to change their
data type.

```{r}
data_diff <- bind_rows(d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,d9,d10,d11)
data_diff$start_station_id <- as.character(data_diff$start_station_id)
data_diff$end_station_id <- as.character(data_diff$end_station_id)
```

Now, combine all data sets into one

```{r}
Bike <- bind_rows(d1,d2,d3,data_diff, d12)
```

Bike has 3489748 rows Since we do not use all the columns, let's drop
some of them

```{r}
Bike <- Bike %>% select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))
```

Our main purpose is to compare the member types so we consider the time.
Therefore, we need to process the columns relate the time

```{r}
#first, change the data type
Bike$started_at <- as.POSIXct(Bike$started_at, tz ="")
Bike$ended_at <- as.POSIXct(Bike$ended_at, tz ="")
#second, we separate these columns in order to make it easy to analyze
Bike$Date_in <- as.Date(format(Bike$started_at), "%Y-%m-%d")
Bike$Date_month <- format(as.Date(format(Bike$started_at), "%Y-%m-%d"), "%Y-%m")
Bike$Date_wd <- format(as.Date(Bike$started_at), "%A")
```

Calculate the time duration of each trips

```{r}
Bike$Time_duration <- difftime(Bike$ended_at, Bike$started_at)
#diff time in seconds
Bike$Time_duration <- as.numeric(Bike$Time_duration)
Bike$Time_duration_hms <- hms(Bike$Time_duration)
```

Now it's time for deeper cleaning

```{r}
Bike <- Bike[!(Bike$start_station_name == "HQ QR"| Bike$Time_duration <=0),] #drop trip that has negative time duration
skim(Bike)
```

Bike now has only 3478810 rows.The data set has N/A value in
*start_station_id* and *end_station_id* which do not affect our analysis
so we don't have to drop these values.

```{r}
summary(Bike$Time_duration)
```

### **ANALYSE -Stories of data**

analyze with member casual

```{r}
#COMPARE 2 TYPES OF MEMBER IN TIME_DURATION
aggregate(Bike$Time_duration~Bike$member_casual, FUN = summary)
aggregate(Bike$Time_duration~Bike$member_casual, FUN = sum)
table(Bike$member_casual)

#COMPARE 2 TYPES OF MEMBER IN DATE_WD
#re-arrange the weekday
Bike$Date_wd <- ordered(Bike$Date_wd, levels= c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday", "Thursday", 
                                                
                                                "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
#note: the ordered function here is to arrange the order of data when you analyze!
aggregate(Bike$Time_duration~Bike$member_casual + Bike$Date_wd,
          FUN = mean)
# COMPARE 2 TYPES OF MEMBER IN MONTH
aggregate(Bike$Time_duration~Bike$member_casual + Bike$Date_month,
          FUN = mean)
```

analyze ridership data by type and weekday

```{r}
Bike %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
            ,average_duration = mean(Time_duration)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)
```

### **SHARE - Visualization**

```{r}
#Total users for both types
Bike %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(Total_rides = n()) %>%
  arrange(Total_rides) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = member_casual, y = Total_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  stat_identity(geom = "text", color = "white", size = 5, aes(label = Total_rides),
                position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Membership Type", values = c(casual ='#ff9900', member = '#0099cc')) +
  labs(title = "Number of Cyclistic Rides", x = "Membership Type", y = "Total Number", subtitle = "From Apr 2020 to Mar 2021")

```

#### Let's visualize the number of rides by weekday

```{r}
#Number of rides per weekday, categorized by membership type
Bike%>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							
            ,average_duration = mean(Time_duration)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill= member_casual)) + geom_col(position = 'dodge') + scale_fill_manual(name = "Membership type", values = c(casual = '#ff9900', member = '#0099cc')) +
 labs(title = "Number of Rides" , x = "Weekday", y = "Total Number", subtitle = "Weekday")

```

Number of rides to membership type by month

```{r}
Bike%>%
  group_by(member_casual, Date_month) %>%  
  summarise(.groups = 'drop', average_duration = mean(Time_duration)) %>%
 arrange(member_casual, Date_month) %>% mutate(Average_Time = hms(average_duration)) %>%
                                            
 ggplot(aes(x = Date_month, y = Average_Time, group = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
 geom_line() + geom_point(size = 3) +
 scale_colour_manual(name = "Membership Type",
 values = c(casual = '#ff9900', member = '#0099cc')) +
 labs(title = "Average Ride Duration By Month", x = "Month", y = "Average Time",
 subtitle = "April 2020 to March 2021") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```

Number of rides to membership type by type of rides

```{r}
Bike %>%
  group_by(rideable_type, member_casual) %>%
  summarise(Total_number = n(), .groups ='drop') %>%
  arrange(Total_number) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = member_casual, y = Total_number, fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  stat_identity(geom = "text", colour = "white", aes(label = Total_number), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = " Bike Type",
    labels = c("classic bike", "docked bike", "electric bike"),
    values = c("#006699", "#ff9900", "#33cc99")) +
  labs(title = "Type of bike by membership type", x = "Membership type", y = "Total number",
       subtitle = "April 2020 to March 2021")
```

### **ACT**

#### CONCLUSION

\- *Member* membership always have higher total number of rides over the
time. However, there is a trend in *Casual* membership that it increases
significantly in the weekend(Saturday and Sunday) which suggests that
*casual* membership could use their bike to go shopping, travel around,
health activities, etc. These activities maybe for entertainment
purpose. Also, *member* membership rides decrease slightly in Sunday,
which could be implied that they are mostly working people.

\- Time duration: *member* has a longer ride duration than *casual*,
nearly 40 minutes to approximately 20 minutes

\- Bike Type: *casual* prefers to use docked bike and electric bike
while these ratios of *member* is lower.

#### SOLUTION

-   Offer more incentives for *member* and increase the renting
    price(especially for docked and electric bike) to promote them being
    casual membership
-   Besides, we could analyze more about locations(I do not do it in
    this part) to focus on where have more potential
    customers(especially for *casual*)
